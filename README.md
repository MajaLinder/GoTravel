## Getting started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@git.ita.chalmers.se:courses/dit341/group-00-web.git

# Change into the directory
cd group-00-web

# Setup backend
cd server && npm install
npm run dev

# Setup frontend

```

> Check out the detailed instructions for [backend](./server/README.md) and [frontend](./client/README.md).

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Open the `server` and `client` in separate VSCode workspaces or open the combined [backend-frontend.code-workspace](./backend-frontend.code-workspace). Otherwise, workspace-specific settings don't work properly.

## System Definition (MS0)

### Purpose

The purpose of GoTravel is to create a platform where the users can inspire each other and share their travel experiences. They can publish posts that include a link and a photo from a hotel, flight, adventure etc. from their trip. For now, there is a limit for a user to add one link and one photo for each post. Each post that they create is rewarded with one point and these points are displayed on their profile. The top five users with the highest points are shown on the ranking page. The user can also choose to edit a post and delete it. In addition, every user has an account to view their individual profile.

### Pages

* Home: The user can view a feed of all available posts. There is a navigation bar that includes a route to the ranking page, a search bar, a login and signout button and a route to the profile page.
* Post: The user can view the details of a chosen post.
* Create post: The user can create a new post.
* Create link and photo: Add a photo and link in the created post.
* Sign up: The user can sign up to create an account.
* Login: The user can login to their account.
* User page: The user can view their profile consisting of their posts and points.
* Ranking: The user can view a ranking list of the top users who has the highest score for created posts.
